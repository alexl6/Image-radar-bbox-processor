# Image-radar bounding box processor

A collection of tools used to track and error-correct image bounding boxes generated by YOLOv4 algorithm, calculate camera-radar plane conversion matrix, convert camera bounding box to radar bounding box.

A set of more 'relaxed' version of environment dependencies is supplied to help with comptability on different systems.

*This repository is in active development and things might change/break before they are finalized.*


### Overview of data processing 
1. Perform bounding box tracking using `image_tracking`
2. Manually find common points in radar and camera dataset (using the tracked boudning box data and `visualization.py` tool)
3. Calculate camera-radar conversion matrix using the tools found in `cr_transform` (requires MATLAB)
4. Export the transformation matrix to `radar_bbox_from_img`
5. Use `imag_to_radar_2.py` to convert camera bbox to radar bbox with 2D matched filter (In-progress)
6. Output radar label (Upcoming)
